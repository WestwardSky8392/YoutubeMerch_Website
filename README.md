In this project we will be creating a website that will advirtize merchdise for a local Youtuber.

  <ul>
    <li> Allow users to view clients mechandise</li>
    <li> Host clients website so anyone can view</li>
    
  </ul>
<h1>Overall Summary</h1>
  <p> Was a small and fun project between us, got some amazing photos to post on this site,
  payments could not be set up due to legal reasons and current size of clients clientel. </p>
